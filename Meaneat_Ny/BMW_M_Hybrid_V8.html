        <p class="text-center">
            The BMW M Hybrid V8 represents the cutting edge of hybrid technology in motorsport. It blends exceptional performance with advanced engineering, 
            making it a powerhouse of speed, efficiency, and innovation. Designed to dominate endurance races, this vehicle underscores BMW's dedication to 
            sustainability and automotive excellence.

            Since the 2023 season, the new car has been battling it out for overall victory in the new GTP class of the IMSA series, at prestigious races like the 24 Hours of Daytona, the 12 Hours of Sebring, and the iconic Petit Le Mans at Road Atlanta. 
            As of the 2024 season, BMW M Motorsport is also competing in the FIA World Endurance Championship with the car. 

            The last big victory for a BMW prototype came in 1999, when the BMW V12 LMR won the 24 Hours of Le Mans. That car also triumphed in the 12 Hours of Sebring in the same season. 

            Regulations specify that LMDh race cars must have both a combustion engine and an electric motor. While each manufacturer can use their own combustion engine, the electric motor, battery, and transmission are standard parts. 
            The BMW M Hybrid V8 is powered by the P66/3 eight-cylinder turbo engine with supplementary electric drive. The combustion engine is based on the DTM unit used in the BMW M4 DTM in 2017 and 2018. 

            During two phases of reconstruction, it underwent comprehensive adjustments to meet the stringent requirements of the LMDh hybrid drive system. The chassis is built by an external partner, with BMW M Motorsport working closely with the legendary Italian race car specialist Dallara.
